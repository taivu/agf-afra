    <ul>
      <li>To fulfill or meet the reason for which the information is provided.

    </ul>
    
    <p>AgFirst will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you any required notice.</p>
    
    <p><u>Sharing Personal Information</u></p>
    
    <p>AgFirst may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose.&nbsp; When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we may enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>
    
    <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we may have disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose:&nbsp; Categories A, B, C, F, I</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Legal entities established pursuant to the Farm Credit Act of 1971.</li>
      <li>Contracts and service providers.</li>
      <li>Third parties to whom we partner to offer products and services to you.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold any personal information.</p>
    
    <p><u>Your Rights and Choices </u></p>
    
    <p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
    
    <p><strong><em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
      <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
      <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
      <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
      <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
      <li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
      <ul>
        <li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
        <li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong><em>Deletion Request Rights </em></strong></p>
    
    <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception or good faith, commercially reasonable business justification applies.</p>
    
    <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
      <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
      <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
      <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
      <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 ).</li>
      <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
      <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
      <li>Comply with a present or potential legal obligation.</li>
      <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
    
    <p>Calling us at <strong>803-462-2025</strong><br>
    Emailing <a href="mailto:joan.edwards107@gmail.com">joan.edwards107@gmail.com</a></p>
    
    <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
    
    <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
      <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We cannot provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
    
    <p><strong><em>Response Timing and Format</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>Pursuant to the CCPA we will attempt to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty five (45) days of its receipt.&nbsp; If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>Pursuant to the CCPA any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.&nbsp; The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p>
    
    <p>We typically do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.&nbsp; If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
    
    <p><u>Non-Discrimination</u></p>
    
    <p>AgFirst will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
      <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
      <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
      <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><u>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</u></p>
    
    <p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will notify you through a notice on our website homepage. <strong>Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</strong></p>
    
    <p><u>Contact Information</u></p>
