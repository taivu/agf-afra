          Farm Tour and Wine Tasting at Gauthier Vineyards


        </h2>
        <p>On Wednesday, September 9, we will be visiting Gauthier Vineyards, LLC. Gauthier Vineyard, LLC is a
          family-owned working farm, equestrian center, vineyard and winery located in scenic New Kent County, Virginia.
          The facility is located 15 miles from Williamsburg.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          We will be traveling by bus as a group to enjoy the beautiful countryside and tour the entire operation,
          followed by a tasting of nine different award-winning wines. The equestrian operation, Hensley Show Horses, is
          a world class equestrian center complete with a barn full of champions. Local relic hunters have also
          validated this land&rsquo;s service as a Civil War encampment for both Union and Confederate forces during the
          lengthy Peninsula Campaign. Come join us on the tour and enjoy a lazy afternoon on the large covered winery
          veranda overlooking the century old pond stocked with bass and numerous snapping turtles. It will be fun,
          informative and relaxing afternoon.<br />

          Places to Visit


        </h2>
        <p class="">
          <strong>Historic Jamestowne</strong><br />
          It is an amazing feeling walking through the site where some of the first British colonists to the New World
          walked and lived. Located on Jamestown Island, Jamestowne was the original capital of Virginia Colony and the
          first English permanent settlement in North America. The life of the early colonists was not easy &ndash; they
          suffered diseases, hunger, and bloody conflict with local Powhatan Indians. The city burned to the ground in
          1676, and all that remains is a brick church tower that stands today as a reminder of human resilience.<br />
          <br />
          The site of the original settlement is an active archeological excavation, and visitors can have a look at
          more than 1,000 discovered artifacts, meet the conservation staff, and learn about their significance and the
          secrets they tell us about the life of early colonists in 17th century. Children are invited to participate in
          sorting through some of the excavated material such as shells, seeds, and animal bones. Park rangers and
          guides in historic costumes offer guided tours through the site of the adjacent Historic Jamestowne, a
          living-history museum and one of the top Williamsburg VA attractions.<br />
          <br />
          <em>Island Drive, Jamestown, VA 23185, 757-856-1250</em><br />
          <br />
          <strong>Colonial Williamsburg</strong><br />
          Walking through the Colonial Williamsburg and passing by people in historic 17th or 18th century clothes may
          feel like you stumbled into the middle of a movie set. They even talk using the diction and grammar of the
          times, which is just different enough that we cannot understand them. You will pass by beautifully restored
          buildings as the Governor&rsquo;s Palace, the Courthouse, the Raleigh Tavern, and the Capitol.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The restoration is so excellent that it is hard to believe that all those lovely old buildings have been
          around for hundreds of years. You can also listen to the music Jefferson liked, watch the 18th century
          dancing, or check one of the city&rsquo;s many excellent restaurants.<br />
          <br />
          <em>101 Visitor Center Dr, Williamsburg, VA 23185, 888-965-7254</em><br />
          <br />
          <strong>Governor&#39;s Palace, Williamsburg, VA</strong><br />
          Built in 1706, the Governor&rsquo;s Palace served as a residence to seven royal governors and the first two
          Virginia elected governors. Everything about the palace was meant to impress and convey British wealth and
          power. The original palace burned down in 1781 and was meticulously reconstructed in 1930, including its grand
          ballroom, elegant furniture, and the huge display of period swords.<br />
